# WHO-pdf-data-MIning
In this project, we are going to convert WHOâ€™s official COVID reporting tables that are available on the official WHO website in form of PDFs to simple data formats i.e. in CSV files. We are going to work with PDF processing using python library PDFMiner. PDF is one of the most important and widely used digital media. used to present and exchange documents. PDFs contain useful information, links and buttons, form fields, audio, video, and business logic. Data manipulation refers to the process of adjusting data to make it organized and easier to read. Data manipulation language, or DML, is a programming language that adjusts data by inserting, deleting, and modifying data in a database such as to cleanse or map the data. In our project, we are using Pandas python library for data manipulation. Data visualization is the discipline of trying to understand data by placing it in a visual context so that patterns, trends, and correlations that might not otherwise be detected can be exposed. Python offers multiple great graphing libraries that come packed with lots of different features
